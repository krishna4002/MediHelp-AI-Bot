This classification is also known as assigned sex at birth, natal sex, biological sex, or simply sex. It's important to note that this classification may not always align with a person's gender identity, which is their internal sense of being male, female, or something else.\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- Source: Data\\Harrison\u2019s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition (Vol.1 & Vol.2).pdf | Title: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Twenty-First Edition (Vol.1 & Vol.2)"
