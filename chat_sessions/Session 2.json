[{"role": "user", "content": "what is fever"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " Fever, in medical terms, is an elevation in the body's core temperature above the normal range, typically defined as 37\u00b0C (\n98.6\u00b0F) or higher. This rise in temperature is an ordinary response by the body to a disruption in its normal physiology, often as a result of an infection or inflammation. The body's immune system triggers fever as a defense mechanism to combat invading pathogens (bacteria, viruses, etc.). Fever helps the body to increase its metabolic rate, enhance the immune response, and make the environment less favorable for the survival of pathogens. However, it's important to note that while fever is generally a sign of the body's efforts to fight off an infection, it can also cause discomfort and may require medical attention if it becomes excessively high or persists for a prolonged period.\n\n---\n\n*Source Docs:*\n\n- Source: Data\\Harrison\u2019s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition (Vol.1 & Vol.2).pdf | Title: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Twenty-First Edition (Vol.1 & Vol.2) \n*Page Content*: chronic glucocorticoid therapy or anti-inflammatory agents such as \nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nTREATMENT\nFever \nTHE DECISION TO TREAT FEVER\nIn deciding whether to treat fever, it is important to remember that \nfever itself is not an illness: it is an ordinary response to a pertur-\nbation of normal host physiology.

As of the end of World War II, there were no drugs specifically designed to treat cancer. However, the development of cancer drug therapy has significantly advanced over the years.\n\nInitially, the primary treatments were alkylating agents and antimetabolites. Alkylating agents work by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, preventing them from dividing and growing. Antimetabolites, on the other hand, interfere with the metabolic processes of the cancer cells, inhibiting their growth and reproduction.\n\nLater, natural products were introduced as cancer treatment options. These are substances derived from plants, bacteria, fungi, or other natural sources that have anticancer properties.\n\nMore recently, the development of molecularly targeted drugs has been a significant breakthrough in cancer treatment. Molecularly targeted drugs, such as imatinib and gefitinib, are designed to interfere with specific molecules involved in cancer growth and spread. Imatinib, for example, targets the BCR-ABL protein, which is found in certain types of leukemia. Gefitinib, on the other hand, targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is often overexpressed in certain types of lung cancer.\n\nIn addition to small molecules, monoclonal antibodies are also being used in cancer treatment. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins designed to recognize and attack specific targets on cancer cells. They can be used either alone or in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy.\n\nIn summary, the evolution of cancer drug therapy has progressed from alkylating agents and antimetabolites to natural products, and most recently, molecularly targeted drugs like imatinib and gefitinib, as well as monoclonal antibodies. As our understanding of cancer biology continues to improve, new targets for therapy are being identified, and more effective and specific treatments are being developed.\n\n---\n\n*Source Docs:*\n\n- Source: Data\\Goodman-Gilmans-The-Pharmacological-Basis-of-Therapeutics-11th-Edition-2006.pdf | Title: N/A \n*Page Content*: that at the end of World War II, there were no drugs to\ntreat this group of diseases (Chabner and Roberts,\n2005).
