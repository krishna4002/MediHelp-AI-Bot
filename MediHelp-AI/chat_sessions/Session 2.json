In the given context, a cancer cell refers to a cell that has undergone uncontrolled growth and division, leading to the formation of a tumor or malignancy.\n                \n2. These cells are abnormal and have the ability to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body, a process known as metastasis.\n                \n3. Cancer cells are characterized by their ability to evade apoptosis (programmed cell death), grow rapidly, and replicate indefinitely.\n                \n4. They are often resistant to treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, making them difficult to eliminate.\n                \n5. The concept of cancer stem cells suggests that within a tumor, there may be a subset of cells with stem cell-like properties, which are responsible for the initiation, progression, and recurrence of cancer.\n                \n6. These cancer stem cells are thought to be more resistant to treatment and have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into various types of cancer cells, contributing to the heterogeneity and aggressiveness of the tumor.\n                \n7. Understanding the hierarchical cell organization within cancers and the role of cancer stem cells is an active area of research, as it may provide insights into developing more effective treatments for cancer.\n\n---\n\n*Source Docs:*\n\n- Source: Data\\Harrison\u2019s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st Edition (Vol.1 & Vol.2).pdf | Title: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Twenty-First Edition (Vol.1 & Vol.2) \n*Page Content*: or stem cells of a cancer, and eliminating them may be necessary for \ncuring the patient.

Hematological symptoms: These are related to the blood and blood-forming organs. Some common symptoms include pallor (pale skin due to anemia), anemia (low red blood cell count), petechiae (small red or purple spots on the skin caused by bleeding under the skin), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count, which can lead to easy bruising or bleeding). These symptoms can be associated with various types of childhood malignancies, such as leukemia and neuroblastoma.\n\n                \n2. Fever and neutropenia: These symptoms can also be associated with cancer cells, particularly those that infiltrate the bone marrow. Neutropenia is a condition characterized by a low number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell), which can make the body more susceptible to infections. Fever can be a sign of an infection, but it can also be a symptom of cancer itself.\n\n                \n3. Systemic symptoms: These are symptoms that affect the entire body. Some common systemic symptoms associated with cancer cells include bone pain, limping, and arthralgia (joint pain). These symptoms can be caused by primary bone tumors or metastasis (the spread of cancer cells) to the bone. Examples of cancers that can cause these symptoms include osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, leukemia, and neuroblastoma.\n\n---\n\n*Source Docs:*\n\n- Source: Data\\Nelson-essentials-of-pediatrics.pdf | Title: N/A \n*Page Content*: 598 SECTION 21 ONCOLOGY\nTABLE 153.2 Common Manifestations of Childhood Malignancies\nSIGN/SYMPTOM SIGNIFICANCE EXAMPLE\nHEMATOLOGICAL\nPallor, anemia Bone marrow infiltration Leukemia, neuroblastoma\nPetechiae, thrombocytopenia Bone marrow infiltration Leukemia, neuroblastoma\nFever, neutropenia Bone marrow infiltration Leukemia, neuroblastoma\nSYSTEMIC\nBone pain, limp, arthralgia Primary bone tumor, metastasis to \nbone\nOsteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, leukemia, \nneuroblastoma"}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is fever"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " Fever is a condition characterized by an elevated body temperature above the normal range, typically defined as \n38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F) or higher. In the given context, fever is one of the criteria used to define a prolonged, undiagnosed illness.
