## 🔧 Setup

1. Create a `.env` file and fill it with your credentials:

```env
HF_TOKEN="your_huggingface_api_token"
PINECONE_API_KEY="your_pinecone_api_key"
PINECONE_ENV="your_pinecone_environment"
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME="your_pinecone_index_name"
```

2. Ensure Pinecone is configured with a suitable index using `"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` as the embedding model.

## 💬 Running the Chatbot

Run the Streamlit interface with:

```bash
streamlit run MediHelp_AI.py
```

Or use the terminal script (`connect_M_w_llm.py`) for CLI interaction:

```bash
python connect_M_w_llm.py
```

## ✍️ Custom Prompt

All interactions use a strict prompt template that:

- Stresses factuality.
- Encourages detailed explanations.
- Disallows hallucinations or fabrications.

## 📝 Session Management

- Sessions are stored in `chat_sessions/` as JSON files.
- Rename, delete, or export chat logs through the UI sidebar.

## 📄 Export

Chats can be exported in `.txt` format from the sidebar.
